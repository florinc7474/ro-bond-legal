## Revision History
- v1.0 (January 2026): Initial version

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the RO Bond mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Florin Constantinescu ("we", "us", "our").

## 2. Description of Service

RO Bond is a mobile application that provides:
- Romanian government bond prices from BVB (Bucharest Stock Exchange) - prices are delayed 15 minutes or more
- Reference interest rates from NBR (National Bank of Romania)
- Investment yield calculations and simulations
- Price alert notifications
- Educational content about bonds

## 3. Important Disclaimer - No Financial Advice

The App is provided for **INFORMATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**.

Nothing in this App constitutes or should be construed as:
- Financial advice or investment advice
- Tax advice or accounting advice
- Legal advice
- A recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities
- A solicitation to invest

The information displayed in the App should **NOT** be relied upon for making financial decisions. Investment in bonds involves risk, including potential loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

**Always consult with a qualified financial advisor, accountant, or other professional before making any investment decisions.**

Your use of data from these sources is subject to their respective terms and conditions. If BVB or NBR change or discontinue their services, certain features of the App may become unavailable or cease to function.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

**To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including EU consumer protection regulations:**

## 12. EU Consumer Rights

### 12.1 Right of Withdrawal

### 12.2 Consumer Guarantees
Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer under EU law. If you are a consumer in the EU, you benefit from mandatory provisions of consumer protection laws that cannot be waived by agreement.

### 12.3 Online Dispute Resolution
The European Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution platform:  
[**EU Consumer Redress Platform (EN)**](https://consumer-redress.ec.europa.eu/index_en)

## 13. Dispute Resolution

### 13.1 Informal Resolution
Before initiating any formal proceedings, you agree to first contact us at [florinc74@gmail.com](mailto:florinc74@gmail.com) to attempt to resolve any dispute informally within 30 days.

### 13.2 Mediation
If informal resolution fails, either party may propose mediation through a mutually agreed mediator in Sibiu, Romania.

### 13.3 Jurisdiction
Any disputes not resolved through the above methods shall be submitted to the competent courts of Sibiu, Romania. This does not affect your right as an EU consumer to bring proceedings in your country of residence.

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Romania, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

For EU consumers, this choice of law does not deprive you of the protection afforded by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement under the law of your country of residence.

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be indicated by:

## 18. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

## 19. No Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

## 20. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the App, superseding any prior agreements or understandings.

## 21. Assignment

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms to any affiliate or successor without restriction.
