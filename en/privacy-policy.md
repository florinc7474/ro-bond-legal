## Revision History
- v1.0 (January 2026): Initial version

## 1. Introduction and Data Controller

Welcome to RO Bond ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Romanian Law No. 190/2018.

This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our RO Bond mobile application ("App").

**Data Controller:**  
Florin Constantinescu  
Sibiu, Romania  
Email: [florinc74@gmail.com](mailto:florinc74@gmail.com)

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide
- **Alert Preferences:** Bond symbols and price thresholds you set for notifications
- **Favorite Bonds:** Bonds you mark as favorites
- **App Settings:** Display preferences, language choice, notification settings, and configuration choices

### 2.2 Information Collected Automatically
- **Network Requests:** The App connects to BVB (Bucharest Stock Exchange) and NBR (National Bank of Romania) APIs to fetch bond data. These requests are made directly from your device. We do not log or store these requests.

### 2.3 Information We Do NOT Collect
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Location data or GPS coordinates
- Device identifiers for tracking or advertising purposes
- Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data
- Financial account information or bank details
- Payment or purchase information
- Biometric data

### 2.4 How We Collect Consent

When you first open the App, you will see a consent screen that:
- Displays links to this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- Requires acceptance before using the App
- Records your consent with timestamp and policy version
- Stores consent record locally on your device

You can withdraw consent at any time by uninstalling the App or contacting us at [florinc74@gmail.com](mailto:florinc74@gmail.com).

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Article 6)

We process the limited data described above based on:

- **Legitimate Interest (Art. 6(1)(f)):** To provide the core functionality of the App, including displaying public financial data and processing user-configured alerts.
- **Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)):** For sending push notifications, which you can enable or disable at any time through your device settings.
- **Contract Performance (Art. 6(1)(b)):** To deliver the service as described in our Terms of Service.

## 4. How We Use Information

The information handled by the App is used solely to:
- Display current Romanian government bond prices and information
- Calculate investment yields and returns
- Send you price alert notifications that you have configured
- Save your preferences locally on your device

### 4.1 Notification Content

**Alert notifications contain only the market information necessary to inform you:**
- The bond data that triggered your configured alert
- Market prices or yields relevant to your alert settings
- Timestamp of the alert

**Notifications protect your privacy:**
- No personal identifying information is included
- No financial account or portfolio details are disclosed
- No tracking identifiers or advertising IDs are used
- Notification content is derived solely from public market data and your local alert preferences

Anyone viewing your notification screen would see only generic bond market information, not your personal or financial details.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

### 5.1 Local Storage Only
**All your data is stored locally on your device only.** We do not have servers that collect or store your personal information.

Data is stored using:
- **SharedPreferences:** For app settings and consent records
- **Local SQLite database:** For favorites and alert configurations

Your alert settings and preferences are saved in your device's local storage and are not transmitted to us or any third party.

### 5.2 Data Security
Since data is stored locally, security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:
- Using device lock (PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or Face ID)
- Keeping your operating system updated
- Not rooting/jailbreaking your device
- Downloading the App only from official stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store)

## 6. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do **NOT** share your data with any third parties.

The App connects directly to the following external services to retrieve publicly available financial data:
- **BVB (Bucharest Stock Exchange):** [https://www.bvb.ro](https://www.bvb.ro) - For bond prices (15-minute delayed data)
- **NBR (National Bank of Romania):** [https://www.bnr.ro](https://www.bnr.ro) - For reference interest rates

These connections are made directly from your device to fetch publicly available market data. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these third-party services. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

**Note:** If BVB or NBR modify or discontinue their APIs, certain features of the App may be affected or become unavailable.

## 7. Your Rights Under GDPR

Under GDPR, you have the following rights:

| Right | How to Exercise |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Access (Art. 15)** | All data is stored locally on your device - you have full access |
| **Rectification (Art. 16)** | Edit directly in App settings |
| **Erasure (Art. 17)** | Clear App data in device settings or uninstall the App |
| **Restriction (Art. 18)** | Disable specific features in App settings |
| **Portability (Art. 20)** | Data is stored locally and accessible to you at any time |
| **Object (Art. 21)** | Contact us or stop using the App |
| **Withdraw Consent** | Revoke via device notification settings at any time |

Since we do not collect personal data on external servers, there is no personal data for us to access, modify, or delete on our end. All your data remains on your device under your control.

## 8. Data Retention

Your data remains on your device until you:
- Clear the App's data in your device settings
- Uninstall the App
- Manually delete specific items (favorites, alerts)

Consent records are retained for the duration of your use of the App and are stored locally on your device.

## 9. Data Breach Notification

In the unlikely event of a security incident affecting the App itself (excluding the user's own device) that may impact user data, we will:
- Assess the risk and scope of the breach
- Notify affected users within 72 hours as required by GDPR Article 33
- Report the breach to ANSPDCP if required by law
- Take immediate steps to mitigate the impact

Given that all user data is stored locally on devices, the risk of data breach from our systems is minimal.

## 10. Children's Privacy

The App is **not intended** for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children. The App provides financial information intended for adult users making investment decisions.

If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at [florinc74@gmail.com](mailto:florinc74@gmail.com).

## 11. International Data Transfers

The App does not transfer your personal data outside your device. API connections to BVB and NBR are made directly from your device to servers located in Romania/EU.

No personal data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

## 12. App Permissions

The App requires the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Required/Optional |

| **VIBRATE** | Vibration feedback for notification alerts | Optional |
| **SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM** | Schedule price checks at specific times (Android 12+) | Optional |
| **RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Restore scheduled alerts after device restart | Optional |

**Note:** On devices running Android versions prior to Android 12, the App uses alternative scheduling mechanisms that do not require `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission.

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be indicated by:
- Updating the "Last updated" date and version number at the top of this policy
- Adding details to the Revision History section

You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
